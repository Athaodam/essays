#  Plants & their stories 

Before there were humans, there were plants. Throughout history, plants have nourished and inspired us in many different ways. Whether it's ancient food recipes, carefully guarded medical cures, or creative projects in music and the arts, the impact of plants are astoundingly present. Unsurprisingly, scholars and plant enthusiasts can agree that humans have extensive relationships with plants... and these relationships are not in one direction. 

Despite laying down sturdy roots, plants are very active and influential. Their unique compositions of chemicals, colours, and dispersion have both helped and harmed us humans across time. In efforts to capture, uplift, and showcase these dyanmic inter-species relationships, the research institution  ==Dumbarton Oaks={Q1264942} coined the term =="Plant Humanities"=={Q104796447} which  "explores and communicates the unparalleled significance of plants to human culture."[^1]

Since its inception in 2018, interest and application of Plant Humanities, as an approach, initiative, and discipline, has grown considerably. This enthusiam for plants has sprouted fruitful partnerships and collabrations both internationally and interdisciplinarily --
