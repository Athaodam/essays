#  Plants Stories

Before there were humans, there were plants. Throughout history, plants have nourished and inspired us in many different ways. Whether it's ancient food recipes, carefully guarded medical cures, or creative projects in music and the arts, the impact of plants are astoundingly present. Unsurprisingly, scholars and plant enthusiasts can agree that humans have extensive relationships with plants... and these relationships are not in one direction. 

Despite laying down sturdy roots, plants are very active and influential. Their unique compositions of chemicals, colours, and dispersion have both helped and harmed us humans across time. In efforts to capture, uplift, and showcase these dynamic inter-species relationships, the research institution ==Dumbarton Oaks=={Q1264942} coined the term =="Plant Humanities"=={Q104796447} which  "explores and communicates the unparalleled significance of plants to human culture."[^1] Since its inception in 2018, interest and application of Plant Humanities, as an approach, initiative, and discipline, has grown considerably. This enthusiasm for plants has sprouted several fruitful collabrations across disciplines and sectors around the world.

Through Plant Humanities, we are able to better understand the overlapping connections human beings have with the nature which surrounds us. These exchanges enhance our affinity for protecting, preserving, and bolstering both ==biodiversity=={Q47041} and ==biocultural diversity=={Q4914734}, which are increasingly threatened by the ongoing impacts of ==climate change=={Q7942}.


# Plants of Cambodia

The Kingdom of ==Cambodia=={Q424} is considered a "biodiversity hotspot" in mainland ==Southeast Asia=={Q11708}.[^2]
Plants are very important in many parts of Cambodian day life and culture. They are eaten as food, made into medicines, used as decoration, and are incorporated into specific rituals for many ==rites of passage=={Q1131696} and community events. Past and ongoing research has demonstrated that many plants fall under what is known as the "food-medicine spectrum", meaning that depending on the context, a given plant can be transformed and consumed for different purposes. While it's easier for us to think in rigid categories, it's also important to reali 

# Our Mission

To understand how people living in Oddar Meanchey Province, Cambodia collection, prepare, and use foraged plants in their daily lives as food, medicine, and beyond.

# Design & approaches

Our project uses a mix of theories and methods from the disciplines of ==ethnobotany=={Q841408}, ==food studies=={Q3232953}, and ==medical anthropology=={Q1779521}. In order to capture individual thoughts, experiences, and perceptions of people with the plants around them we conducted semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked a series of questions relating to their foraging practices, individual plant species and their uses, as well as their feelings about the relationships between food and medicine overall. We supplemented this with 

# Our Team

The Plant Planet Plate team is consists of plant-loving people, with experiences in research, agriculture, gardening, and more. The team is lead by Dr. Ashley Thuthao Keng Dam from Maastricht University and Muneezay Jaffery of Green Shoots Foundation.

# Our Community 

Plant Planet Plate has been generously funded by the ==National Geographic Society=={Q167186} under their Explorer Grant Scheme. It is a collaborative effort between academic institutions and NGOs based in Cambodia, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Namely: ==Maastricht University (The Netherlands)=={Q1137652}, Green Shoots Foundation (United Kingdom), The ==Royal University of Phnom Penh=={Q1709572}, The National Herbarium of Cambodia, The ==Royal University of Agriculture (Cambodia)=={Q7374951}, and the ==University of Battambang (Cambodia)=={Q30265680}.
